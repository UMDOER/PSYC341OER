## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide an open-source, ever-expanding body of information for PSYC341: Introduction to Memory and Cognition. This platform, Github, allows many users to contribute to the main site or make their own variations. Ideally, this site will provide a mix of written and multimedia information to encourage learning through several mediums.

## How to Contribute
### Branching

The current site--called the "repository"--is the center for editing and branching. Changes to the main branch, or the "master" branch, will be pushed to the published site: https://umdoer.github.io/PSYC341OER/.

When editing, you can push your changes to the master branch, or fork to a new seperate branch. Forking is essentially making a copy; editing your seperate branch will not affect the master branch.
