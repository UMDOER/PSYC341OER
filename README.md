## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide an open-source, ever-expanding body of information for PSYC341: Introduction to Memory and Cognition. This platform, Github, allows many users to contribute to the main site or make their own variations. Ideally, this site will provide a mix of written and multimedia information to encourage learning through several mediums.    

The site falls under Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universa licensure.

## How to Contribute
### Forking

The current site--called the "repository"--is the center for editing and branching. Changes to the main branch, or the "master" branch, will be pushed to the published site: https://umdoer.github.io/PSYC341OER/.

When editing, you can commit your changes to the master branch, or fork to a new seperate branch. Forking is essentially making a copy; editing your seperate branch will not affect the master branch. You will be able to access your site through the URL provided under the "Settings" tab:

### Pull Requests

To propose a change without editing directly, you can issue a pull request. This request will allow you to add comments and discuss the changes with collaborators before the edits are published.

### Editing in Markdown

Pages that end with **.md** can be edited using Markdown, an easy way of editing Github pages. Editing in markdown is simple; [this page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) outlines the basics.


## Navigating the Repository

The repository is organized into several folders on the main page:
